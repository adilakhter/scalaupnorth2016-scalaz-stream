# Functional Stream Processing with Scala - Scala Up North 2016


##Abstract

Scalaz-stream (soon to be called "FS2") is a library that facilitates purely functional API to encode asynchronous stream processing in a modular and composable manner. Due to its functional abstraction around "streams" of data, scalaz-streams enables isolating and delaying the side-effects until the streams are fully composed and assembled into its final execution context. The main objective of this talk is to get started scalaz-stream, with its functional approach to stream processing, and to dive into details of its semantics (for instance, Task, Process, Channel and so on). This talk will introduce the basic principles of scalaz-stream and will demonstrate on how easily we can define streams modularly, and how effectively we can compose these functional streams to solve problems of distributed systems. No knowledge of advanced functional programming is assumed.
